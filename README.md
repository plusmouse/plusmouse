I work on World of Warcraft addons, including Auctionator, putting in a lot of time and effort to make them work well and add new features.

Addons I work on:
- [Auctionator](https://github.com/Auctionator/Auctionator/) - Auction house addon, including shopping, selling and cancelling tabs and a full scan feature to save the current prices to show them in tooltips.
- [Prat](https://github.com/Legacy-of-Sylvanaar/prat-3-0) - Chat addon, filtering messages and UI changes
- [Baganator](https://github.com/Auctionator/Baganator/) - Single view bag or bank, sorting, browsing alt inventories, currency tracking and item location info tooltips.
- [Journalator](https://github.com/Auctionator/Journalator/) - Tracks: Auction house activity, vendoring, questing, loot and crafting orders
- [Collectionator](https://github.com/Auctionator/Collectionator/) - Shows unlearned transmog, pets, recipes, toys and mounts on the auction house.
- [Point Blank Sniper](https://github.com/Auctionator/PointBlankSniper) - Find underpriced items quickly on the auction house with a well configured shopping list
- [Craft Info Anywhere](https://github.com/plusmouse/CraftInfoAnywhere) - See the cost to craft and the reagents needed on the tooltip of any item
