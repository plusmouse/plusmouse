I work on World of Warcraft addons, including Auctionator, putting in a lot of time and effort to make them work well and add new features.

Addons I work on:
- [Auctionator](https://github.com/TheMouseNest/Auctionator/) - Auction house addon, including shopping, selling and cancelling tabs and a full scan feature to save the current prices to show them in tooltips.
- [Baganator](https://github.com/TheMouseNest/Baganator/) - Category groups or single bag inventory addon, searching, sorting, browsing offline inventories, currency tracking and item location info tooltips.
- [Platynator](https://github.com/TheMouseNest/Platynator) - Highly flexible and optimised nameplates with easy to use settings.
- [Chattynator](https://github.com/TheMouseNest/Chattynator/) - Chat frame overhaul. With smooth scrollings and many QoL features.
- [Journalator](https://github.com/TheMouseNest/Journalator/) - Tracks: Auction house activity, vendoring, questing, loot and crafting orders
- [Collectionator](https://github.com/TheMouseNest/Collectionator/) - Shows unlearned transmog, pets, recipes, toys and mounts on the auction house.

### Development Policy
1. For features, if it requires lots of explanation to get to the point of why it might be useful, scrap it 😛
2. There must be zero setup to get started 🥳
